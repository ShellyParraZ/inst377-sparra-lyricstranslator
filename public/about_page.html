      <h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
      <p id="purpose_paragraph">
        The purpose of this project is to help users better understand song
        lyrics that are written in languages they do not speak fluently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although many music streaming platforms provide access to lyrics,
        language barriers can prevent listeners from fully
      </p>
      <p>appreciating the emotion and message behind a song.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This Lyrics Translator allows users to search for a song by title and
        artist, view the original lyrics, and receive a translated version
      </p>
      <p>
        in their chosen language. By combining Lyrics.ovh API, which retrieves
        lyrics, with DeepL Translate API, a translator, the project
      </p>
      <p>
        aims to make music more accessible and inclusive for a global audience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This project uses modern web tools and APIs to create a web application
        that runs on a real server (Node.js). It pulls lyrics from
      </p>
      <p>
        external sources, translates them into different languages, stores
        translations for efficiency, and is deployed on Vercel for easy access.
